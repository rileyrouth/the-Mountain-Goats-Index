title: Estate Sale Sign
---
Crude little wooden idols \\
And aviator shades \\
The trinkets and the treasures \\
We brought back from the crusades

Some guy in an Impala \\
Shakes his head when he rides by \\
But I remember when \\
We shared a vision, you and I

Worked hard to build this altar \\
We made it earn its keep \\
The cracks across its surface \\
Spiderweb while we're asleep

The sacrificial stains \\
All spreading out and soaking through \\
But I remember when \\
We kept it pretty, me and you

And high above the water \\
The eagle spots the fish \\
Every martyr in this jungle \\
Is gonna get his wish

Stock shots, stupid stock shots \\
From the Pomona mall \\
Set up like unloved icons \\
Gathering dust up on the wall

From films no one remembers \\
They call down silently \\
But I remember when their names \\
Were dear to you and me \\
Yeah

Pennies on the dollar \\
Everything's gotta go \\
The things that we can't even give away \\
I don't wanna know

Try to see if secrets burn \\
When you hold them up into the light \\
I remember when \\
We loved each other day and night

And high above the water \\
The eagle spots the fish \\
Every martyr in this jungle \\
Is gonna get his wish
